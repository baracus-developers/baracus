Baracus is currently under 2.x development to make use of the Perl Dancer framework.

  http://perldancer.org/

Packages for Dancer are maintained in obs://devel:languages:perl/

  zypper ar -f obs://devel:languages:perl/openSUSE_11.4 d:l:p

As is Baracus:

  zypper ar -f obs://systemsmanagement:baracus/openSUSE_11.4 baracus

(Adjust openSUSE_11.4 to your platform name.)


You've probably already cloned baracus from the gitorious site:

  https://gitorious.org/baracus

using

  git clone git@gitorious.org:baracus/baracus.git


If not you may need to provide your gitorious username to 

   das_deniz@comcast.net 
or 
   cruejones@comcast.net

So that you can be added to the project, and have access.



Once you have cloned baracus you can

  cd baracus/Baracus

and see what's in this "Dancer" top level directory structure which was created using

  # dancer -a Baracus  # you DO NOT want to do this now/again

and populated with the old 1.x Baracus development files.

  
We are actively reworking old /usr/sbin/ files into ./lib/Baracus/REST/
while reusing as much of the old /usr/share/baracus/perl relocated to ./lib/Baracus/.


Dancer has a few files which may need attention to get started

  config.yml       # high level config file
                   # should already have desired settings

  environments/development.yml  # specifies the db to use
                                # and the admin user creds


So you need to modify your db.  This section assumes you've installed
the 1.x version of baracus from rpm and have the /etc/sysconfig/baracusdb and
/etc/init.d/baracusdb files.  After you confirm that you have these files, do

  service baracusdb start

It will create the db and the necessary files for the following modifications.

First, modify the pg_hba.conf file like so:

edit bottom of file: ~baracus/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf

- host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            ident
+ host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            password


And restart the db using

  service baracusdb restart

Then, add the dancing baracus admin user/pass and database to postgres like so:

  ./scripts/createuser.sh
  ./scripts/createdb.sh
    

Then we need to run ./bin/app.pl once to make sure the db is populated with the needed tables

  ./bin/app.pl

and after moment ctrl-c out of this.

Finally we need to add the admin baracus user so we can run baracus cmds and add other users.

  ./scripts/psql.sh

(this could be vastly simplified :)
